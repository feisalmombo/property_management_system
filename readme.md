## Property Management System (PMS)

A Property Management System (PMS) is a tool that helps a landlord or manager keep track of their houses, apartments, rooms and tenants.

1. Create Property – Add the name of the house or apartment and where it is located.

Example: "Sunrise Apartments – Kinondoni"

2. Create Tenant – Add the details of the person renting (name, phone, email).

Example: "John Doe – 0712 345 678"

3. Assign Tenant to Property (Lease) – Link the tenant to a specific house with a start date and rent period (1–6 months). The system automatically calculates when the rent will end.

4. Overdue Tenants – Show tenants who have not paid their rent. These are highlighted (e.g., in red) so the landlord knows who is behind.

5. Expiring Tenants – Show tenants whose rent period is about to finish soon (e.g., within the next 15 days). These are highlighted (e.g., in yellow) so the landlord can remind them early.
